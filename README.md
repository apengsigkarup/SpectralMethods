# SpectralMethods
Teaching materials for a course on spectral methods for numerical discretization

To clone the repository files, run the following command from the command line

    git clone https://github.com/apengsigkarup

The recommended way to install the necessary code to work with and run the exercises is to install the environment using conda

    conda create -n Spectral-env
    conda activate Spectral-env
    conda install -r environment.yaml

In the Exercises/ directory there are some notebooks that contains selected problems for Spectral Methods useful in Scientific Computing. In each exercise the task is to complete the code in all cells where '\<DEFINE THIS\>' is stated. The notebooks contains figures of results that was obtained in the complete solution and hence is the target to reproduce. Eeach notebook may also just contain examples that give a basis for your own exploration.

## Running the notebooks on Google Colab
Make sure you have a Google account, since this give access to use Google Colab.

1. Go to the Google Colab website https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb and login with your Google account (if you are not already logged in).
2. Then hit File->Open Notebook.
3. In the pop up window that opens, click on GitHub.
4. Write https://github.com/apengsigkarup/SpectralMethods/Exercises and hit enter.
5. Select the notebook you would like to open. For example, select "Exercises/01_Notebook_Fourier_Series_1D.ipynb".
