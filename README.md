# SpectralMethods
Teaching materials for a course on spectral methods for numerical discretization

To clone the repository files, run the following command from the command line

    git clone https://github.com/apengsigkarup

The recommended way to install the necessary code to work with and run the exercises is to install the environment using conda

    conda create -n Spectral-env
    conda activate Spectral-env
    conda install -r environment.yaml

In the Exercises/ directory there are some notebooks that contains selected problems for Spectral Methods useful in Scientific Computing. In each exercise the task is to complete the code in all cells where '<DEFINE THIS>' is stated. The notebooks contains figures of results that was obtained in the complete solution and hence is the target to reproduce. Eeach notebook may also just contain examples that give a basis for your own exploration.
